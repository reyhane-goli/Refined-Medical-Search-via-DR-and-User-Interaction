# Refined-Medical-Search-via-DR-and-User-Interaction

This project implement the log augmented dense retrieval approach introduced by Jin, Shin, and Lu in 2023, with a focus on enhancing and reproducing their methodology using the comprehensive TripClick IR benchmark dataset. Traditional retrieval systems, such as BM25, often struggle with vocabulary and semantic mismatches, limiting their ability to effectively match user queries with relevant documents. Our study aims to overcome these limitations by employing dense retrieval models that utilize contextual embeddings to capture deeper semantic meanings of queries and documents, offering a more nuanced approach to information retrieval. As part of our research, we have extended the original model by utilizing all available training data, rather than just a subset, and by exploring a second dense retrieval model. Moreover, we have integrated user query reformulation behavior into the retrieval process, aiming to further enhance the ranking effectiveness. These modifications are designed to test the hypothesis that a deeper understanding of user interactions and behavior can improve the relevance of search results.
